# Health inspection email reminders

Recipient and sender: service@bluelifepools.com. Messages and ticket labels are in English.
The Vercel production cron runs daily at 13:00 UTC (08:00 America/Bogota).
On Hobby plans the actual invocation can occur later within that hour.
No open browser or logged-in user is required.

## Activation

1. In the existing Microsoft Entra app, add Microsoft Graph **Application** permission **Mail.Send** and grant tenant administrator consent. Do not add Mail.ReadWrite.
2. In the Vercel **backend** project's Production environment, add **CRON_SECRET** with a cryptographically random value of at least 32 characters. Never use a user password or commit this value.
3. Redeploy the backend and verify its Cron Jobs page.
4. GET /health-department/reminders/status must show mailSendPermission and schedulerConfigured both true.
5. An administrator can invoke POST /health-department/reminders/run using their existing Health or Chemicals bearer token. This is a real run and sends eligible reminders, not a test preview.

Optional HEALTH_REMINDER_TIMEZONE defaults to America/Bogota.
Optional HEALTH_APP_URL defaults to the production frontend.

## Rules and reliability

- Use the assigned Inspection date (healthData Fecha de Inicio); fall back to visitDate only if that CSV field does not exist. An explicitly cleared inspection date never generates a reminder.
- Exclude closed, deleted, undated and past inspections.
- Reminders occur in the 10-, 5- and 1-day windows. If a run is delayed or a date is assigned late, send only the current window, not all missed reminders.
- A database unique key on ticket ID, inspection date and window prevents duplicates across concurrent/repeated invocations.
- Editing the inspection date creates a new reminder schedule. The worker checks the date/status again immediately before sending.
- ACCEPTED means Graph accepted the message, not guaranteed inbox delivery. Mailbox delivery rules still apply.
- Definite rejected submissions are FAILED and retryable. Timeouts, ambiguous responses, or interruption leave UNKNOWN/SUBMITTING and are NOT automatically resent, to avoid duplicate emails. Review Service's Sent Items before changing these records.
- The latest five comments and inspection details are included, with HTML escaped.
- No test messages are sent automatically during deployment.
